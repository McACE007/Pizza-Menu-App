# Project Title: The Fast React Pizza Co. App

# Description: 
The Fast React Pizza Co. app is a react application designed to display the menu items and additional information about the pizza company. It utilizes react components to break down the application into reusable parts. The application includes a list of pizza items with their corresponding prices and a description of each pizza.


# Key Features

**1.  Navigation:** The application includes a simple navigation bar at the top of the page with links to different sections of the app.
    
**2.  Menu List:** The main component of the app is the list of pizza items, each displayed in a separate card. The cards include the name of the pizza, a description, and the price.
    
**3.  Pizza Item Details:** Each pizza item in the list has a corresponding button that, when clicked, reveals additional details about the pizza. These details include a brief description of the pizza and the ingredients used.
    
**4.  Cons Section:** The app includes a "Cons" section that highlights the flaws or negative aspects of the company's offerings. In this case, the focus is on the focaccia bread, which is known for its hard texture and heavy breadiness.
    
**5.  Additional Information:** The app also provides additional information about the company, such as its hours of operation and a call-to-action for users to either visit the restaurant or order online.
